  abstract  = {Typical use cases like financial trading or monitoring of manufacturing equipment pose huge challenges regarding end to end latency as well as throughput towards existing data stream processing systems. Established solutions like Apache S4 or Storm need to scale out to a large set of hosts to meet these challenges. An ideal system can react to workload changes by on demand acquisition or release of hosts. Thereby, it can handle unexpected peak loads as well as improve the average utilization of the system. This property is called elasticity.The major challenge for an elastic scaling system is to find the right point in time to scale in or out. To determine this right point is difficult, because it depends on constantly changing system and workload characteristics. In this demonstration, we apply three alternative auto-scaling techniques known from other domains on top of an existing elastic data stream processing system. A user of the demonstration can experience the influence of the chosen auto-scaling technique on the latency and the system utilization using a real-world use case based on different workloads from the Frankfurt stock exchange.},

  abstract  = {Existing machine learning inference-serving systems largely rely on hardware scaling by adding more devices or using more powerful accelerators to handle increasing query demands. However, hardware scaling might not be feasible for fixed-size edge clusters or private clouds due to their limited hardware resources. A viable alternate solution is accuracy scaling, which adapts the accuracy of ML models instead of hardware resources to handle varying query demands. This work studies the design of a high-throughput inference-serving system with accuracy scaling that can meet throughput requirements while maximizing accuracy. To achieve the goal, this work proposes to identify the right amount of accuracy scaling by jointly optimizing three sub-problems: how to select model variants, how to place them on heterogeneous devices, and how to assign query workloads to each device. It also proposes a new adaptive batching algorithm to handle variations in query arrival times and minimize SLO violations. Based on the proposed techniques, we build an inference-serving system called Proteus and empirically evaluate it on real-world and synthetic traces. We show that Proteus reduces accuracy drop by up to 3\texttimes{} and latency timeouts by 2--10\texttimes{} with respect to baseline schemes, while meeting throughput requirements.},

  abstract   = {Deep learning (DL) has demonstrated its remarkable success in a wide variety of fields. The development of a DL model is a time-consuming and resource-intensive procedure. Hence, dedicated GPU accelerators have been collectively constructed into a GPU datacenter. An efficient scheduler design for a GPU datacenter is crucially important to reduce operational cost and improve resource utilization. However, traditional approaches designed for big data or high-performance computing workloads can not support DL workloads to fully utilize the GPU resources. Recently, many schedulers are proposed to tailor for DL workloads in GPU datacenters. This article surveys existing research efforts for both training and inference workloads. We primarily present how existing schedulers facilitate the respective workloads from the scheduling objectives and resource utilization manner. Finally, we discuss several promising future research directions including emerging DL workloads, advanced scheduling decision making, and underlying hardware resources.

  abstract  = {Machine learning inference is becoming a core building block for interactive web applications. As a result, the underlying model serving systems on which these applications depend must consistently meet low latency targets. Existing model serving architectures use well-known reactive techniques to alleviate common-case sources of latency, but cannot effectively curtail tail latency caused by unpredictable execution times. Yet the underlying execution times are not fundamentally unpredictable--on the contrary we observe that inference using Deep Neural Network (DNN) models has deterministic performance.Here, starting with the predictable execution times of individual DNN inferences, we adopt a principled design methodology to successively build a fully distributed model serving system that achieves predictable end-to-end performance. We evaluate our implementation, Clockwork, using production trace workloads, and show that Clockwork can support thousands of models while simultaneously meeting 100 ms latency targets for 99.9999\% of requests. We further demonstrate that Clockwork exploits predictable execution times to achieve tight request-level service-level objectives (SLOs) as well as a high degree of request-level performance isolation.},

  abstract      = {Understanding the consequences of regulatory variation in the human genome remains a major challenge, with important implications for understanding gene regulation and interpreting the many disease-risk variants that fall outside of protein-coding regions. Here, we provide a direct window into the regulatory consequences of genetic variation by sequencing RNA from 922 genotyped individuals. We present a comprehensive description of the distribution of regulatory variation--by the specific expression phenotypes altered, the properties of affected genes, and the genomic characteristics of regulatory variants. We detect variants influencing expression of over ten thousand genes, and through the enhanced resolution offered by RNA-sequencing, for the first time we identify thousands of variants associated with specific phenotypes including splicing and allelic expression. Evaluating the effects of both long-range intra-chromosomal and trans (cross-chromosomal) regulation, we observe modularity in the regulatory network, with three-dimensional chromosomal configuration playing a particular role in regulatory modules within each chromosome. We also observe a significant depletion of regulatory variants affecting central and critical genes, along with a trend of reduced effect sizes as variant frequency increases, providing evidence that purifying selection and buffering have limited the deleterious impact of regulatory variation on the cell. Further, generalizing beyond observed variants, we have analyzed the genomic properties of variants associated with expression and splicing and developed a Bayesian model to predict regulatory consequences of genetic variants, applicable to the interpretation of individual genomes and disease studies. Together, these results represent a critical step toward characterizing the complete landscape of human regulatory variation.},

  abstract = {We propose the elastic net, a new regularization and variable selection method. Real world data and a simulation study show that the elastic net often outperforms the lasso, while enjoying a similar sparsity of representation. In addition, the elastic net encourages a grouping effect, where strongly correlated predictors tend to be in or out of the model together. The elastic net is particularly useful when the number of predictors (p) is much bigger than the number of observations (n). By contrast, the lasso is not a very satisfactory variable selection method in the p≫n case. An algorithm called LARS-EN is proposed for computing elastic net regularization paths efficiently, much like algorithm LARS does for the lasso.},

Here we report sequencing and deep analysis of messenger RNA and microRNA from lymphoblastoid cell lines of 462 individuals from the 1000 Genomes Project--the first uniformly processed high-throughput RNA-sequencing data from multiple human populations with high-quality genome sequences. We discover extremely widespread genetic variation affecting the regulation of most genes, with transcript structure and expression level variation being equally common but genetically largely independent. Our characterization of causal regulatory variation sheds light on the cellular mechanisms of regulatory and loss-of-function variation, and allows us to infer putative causal variants for dozens of disease-associated loci. Altogether, this study provides a deep understanding of the cellular mechanisms of transcriptome variation and of the landscape of functional variants in the human genome.},

These data enabled us to assign biochemical functions for 80{\%} of the genome, in particular outside of the well-studied protein-coding regions. Many discovered candidate regulatory elements are physically associated with one another and with expressed genes, providing new insights into the mechanisms of gene regulation. The newly identified elements also show a statistical correspondence to sequence variants linked to human disease, and can thereby guide interpretation of this variation. Overall, the project provides new insights into the organization and regulation of our genes and genome, and is an expansive resource of functional annotations for biomedical research.},

Here we introduce a powerful strategy that integrates gene expression measurements with summary association statistics from large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to identify genes whose cis-regulated expression is associated with complex traits. We leverage expression imputation from genetic data to perform a transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) to identify significant expression-trait associations. We applied our approaches to expression data from blood and adipose tissue measured in ∼3,000 individuals overall. We imputed gene expression into GWAS data from over 900,000 phenotype measurements to identify 69 new genes significantly associated with obesity-related traits (BMI, lipids and height). Many of these genes are associated with relevant phenotypes in the Hybrid Mouse Diversity Panel.

However, the biological mechanisms underlying these associations are, in general, not well understood. We propose a gene-based association method called PrediXcan that directly tests the molecular mechanisms through which genetic variation affects phenotype. The approach estimates the component of gene expression determined by an individual's genetic profile and correlates 'imputed' gene expression with the phenotype under investigation to identify genes involved in the etiology of the phenotype. Genetically regulated gene expression is estimated using whole-genome tissue-dependent prediction models trained with reference transcriptome data sets. PrediXcan enjoys the benefits of gene-based approaches such as reduced multiple-testing burden and a principled approach to the design of follow-up experiments. Our results demonstrate that PrediXcan can detect known and new genes associated with disease traits and provide insights into the mechanism of these associations.},

Despite continuous misunderstandings and controversies over its use and application, heritability remains key to the response to selection in evolutionary biology and agriculture, and to the prediction of disease risk in medicine. Recent reports of substantial heritability for gene expression and new estimation methods using marker data highlight the relevance of heritability in the genomics era.},

  abstract      = {Genetic association studies, in particular the genome-wide association study design, have provided a wealth of novel insights into the aetiology of a wide range of human diseases and traits. The next challenge consists of understanding the molecular basis of these associations. The integration of multiple association datasets, including gene expression datasets, can contribute to this goal. We have developed a novel statistical methodology to assess whether two association signals are consistent with a shared causal variant. An application is the integration of disease scans with expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) studies, but any pair of GWAS datasets can be integrated in this framework. We demonstrate the value of the approach by reanalysing a gene expression dataset in 966 liver samples with a published meta-analysis of lipid traits including {\textgreater}100, 000 individuals of European ancestry. Combining all lipid biomarkers, our reanalysis supported 29 out of 38 reported colocalisation results with eQTLs and identified 14 new colocalisation results, highlighting the value of a formal statistical test. In two cases of reported eQTL-lipid pairs (IFT172, TBKBP1) for which our analysis suggests that the eQTL pattern is not consistent with the lipid association, we identify alternative colocalisation results with GCKR and KPNB1, indicating that these genes are more likely to be causal in these genomic intervals. A key feature of the method is the ability to derive the output statistics from single SNP summary statistics, hence making it possible to perform systematic meta-analysis type comparisons across multiple GWAS datasets (http://coloc.cs.ucl.ac.uk/coloc/). Our methodology provides information about candidate causal genes in associated intervals and has direct implications for the understanding of complex diseases and the design of drugs to target disease pathways.},

  abstract = {Understanding the functional consequences of genetic variation, and how it affects complex human disease and quantitative traits, remains a critical challenge for biomedicine. We present an analysis of RNA sequencing data from 1641 samples across 43 tissues from 175 individuals, generated as part of the pilot phase of the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project. We describe the landscape of gene expression across tissues, catalog thousands of tissue-specific and shared regulatory expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) variants, describe complex network relationships, and identify signals from genome-wide association studies explained by eQTLs. These findings provide a systematic understanding of the cellular and biological consequences of human genetic variation and of the heterogeneity of such effects among a diverse set of human tissues.$\backslash$nExpression, genetic variation, and tissues$\backslash$nHuman genomes show extensive genetic variation across individuals, but we have only just started documenting the effects of this variation on the regulation of gene expression. Furthermore, only a few tissues have been examined per genetic variant. In order to examine how genetic expression varies among tissues within individuals, the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) Consortium collected 1641 postmortem samples covering 54 body sites from 175 individuals. They identified quantitative genetic traits that affect gene expression and determined which of these exhibit tissue-specific expression patterns. Mel{\'{e}} et al. measured how transcription varies among tissues, and Rivas et al. looked at how truncated protein variants affect expression across tissues.$\backslash$nScience, this issue p. 648, p. 660, p. 666; see also p. 640},
